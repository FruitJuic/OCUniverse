# Early Life

Aries Costiallis was originally a local engineer and mechanic for his small town on [[K385]]. He fixed appliances, Helped with vehicles, and any other things that were brought to him. At the age of 16, he was told of a opportunity to join [[The Guard]], and seeing an chance to advance his skills and maybe meet some new people, He accepted, and was brought aboard the [[Engineering Division]]. 

# Joining of [[The Guard]]

Being 16 years of age, Aries was the youngest engineer to be working on the aircraft and other devices. But being the youngest did not make him the weakest, as he quickly outperformed most adults in his field. His employers and bosses took notice of his skills, and set him to work on the newer models. Aries originally worked on  the [[SA-3 Eagle]] and his most notable work on the [[SA-32 Condor]]. 

# Work on the Condor

The [[SA-32 Condor]] was designed, planned, and largely built by Aries alone and in secret, over 2 years, and ate into most of his spare time. He had been assigned to craft maintenance but felt this was a waste of his skills. The main plans were sketched via a notebook, and were taken from other ships, improving upon their designs and fixing their issues. During late nights and spare breaks, he would plan out, assemble parts, and fit them into place on a model [[SA-32 Condor]]. Eventually, he got found by some of the engineers, and when word spread of his work, Aries's project went to the head of the engineering division. They gave him a meeting with the higher ups of [[The Guard]], and after a small discussion, the [[SA-32 Condor]] project was formalized and he was assigned as the head engineer of it, and had people to help him with building. At the age of 19, he finished a small collection of Ships, and began to distribute them among the rest of [[The Guard]]. 

# Working on 8th Gen Fighters

He eventually ended up working closely with a highly ranked pilot in the guard, [[Aurora Astra]]. They would often discuss plane designs on breaks from the perspective of both an engineer and pilot. They worked closely to make 8th gen fighters as effective to construct and fly as possible.
