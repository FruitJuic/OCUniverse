The Siege of Gluk was an attack intended to take out the central government of planet C385 and put it under possession of the government of [[K385]].

It was operated on the [[Second Guard]] and ran as a joint battle between the [[Aerospace Division]] and the [[Ground Division]].

[[Aurora Astra]] led a group of four fighter pilots in providing escort for the [[Transport Class]] craft that was carrying the [[Ground Division]] soldiers. Upon the landing of the transport they switched to providing air support for the siege.

3 enemy fighters were sent to take out their craft. These were more advanced then the [[SA-3 Eagle]] that the [[Second Guard]] pilots were operating, but since they had more planes they were able to out maneuver and ultimately take down the enemy.
