The SA-32 is a 7th gen [[SA Fighter Class]] type craft.


# Weapons

The Condor is equipped with 4 air to air missiles capable of operating both in and out of an atmosphere. 2 of these are mounted on the top of the aircraft and the other 2 mounted on the bottom. For the top missiles to function in atmosphere the aircraft must be flown inverted in order to allow the missiles to create distance from the fuselage before engaging the rocket system. Out of atmosphere the missiles will be pushed away mechanically and adjust there course automatically. The craft is additionally armed with an under-mounted gun for additional weaponry.

# Engines

The Condor is equipped with 2 jet engines for use in atmosphere and 1 rocket engine in order to transition to out of atmosphere flight. In addition, there are 7 small rockets use for rotation along the 3 axis while out of atmosphere. These course correction engines are mounted on the underside of the craft and can be used in atmosphere to generate additional lift if necessary to prevent stalls. Finally, there are 2 front facing thrusters used as the primary method of slowing the craft out of atmosphere and an additional method in atmosphere.

# Flight Controls

The craft is flown with a side stick and throttle controls. The throttle controls are split into two segments near each other. One segment has the controls for the two jet engines while the other has the throttle for the rocket engine. The aircraft has a switch to swap the side stick between the traditional flight controls and the adjustment thrusters. There are additionally switches used to individually control these thrusters for more fine control, though this is challenging to coordinate and not required for operation of the craft.

# Variable Wing Geometry

The Condor's wings are designed with 2 flight modes. When extended out they are able to generate a larger amount of lift, useful for takeoffs and low speed maneuvers. They can then be moved inwards in order to allow more maneuverability and higher speeds. When flying in atmosphere it is recommended to operate in the high lift mode when under 250 knots and switch to high maneuverability when above 250 knots. Out of atmosphere it is not recommended to use the high maneuverability mode as it moved the roll adjustment thrusters too far aft of the center of gravity, causing a pitching motion to be associated with rolling.

# Primary Maneuvers

In atmosphere, a takeoff is performed by putting both jet engines to max throttle and accelerating to 150 knots and pulling back gently on the side stick to rotate and climb.

Alternatively, a high performance in atmosphere takeoff can be performed by additionally engaging the rocket engine in order to accelerate much quicker. The aircraft can also be pulled into a steeper climb. This is ideal when the flight plan leads quickly into out of atmosphere flight.

When taking off from a spacecraft carrier you will treat it like a normal takeoff until reaching the edge of the localized atmosphere at which point you will perform a standard transition to out of atmosphere flight and continue of the flight plan.

Landing in atmosphere is done with a 3 degree glide slope down to the runway. If fast reverse thrust can be applied via the adjustment boosters as the front of the aircraft. These can additionally be applied on the ground to slow the aircraft further. The optimal approach speed is 145 knots in order to maintain a good glide slope.

Landing on a spacecraft carrier is done similarly, but requires a transition to in atmosphere flight very quickly before touchdown which can be challenging to newer pilots. It is recommended to begin transitions flight modes as soon as possible when entering the localized atmosphere in order to give as much time as needed to focus on the touchdown on the carrier.

# Inter-Atmospheric Flight Transitions


## Into Atmosphere

The easiest way to transition into atmospheric flight on a planet is to pitch down and begin a slow descent towards the surface. When approaching 50,000 feet above the surface begin reducing throttle from the rocket engine and engage the jet engines. Once power has been fully shifted into the jet engines the aircraft is considered to be in atmospheric flight.

A faster method is to point your craft into a nose dive towards the planet's surface. You will then cut the rocket engine and wait until you reach 50,000 feet above the surface or lower if necessary. At this point you engage both jet engines and pull up out of the maneuver to enter standard atmospheric flight.

When transitioning into a localized atmosphere for a spacecraft carrier you will begin by flying a standard approach to land. When you get within the range of the localized atmosphere immediately cut the throttle of the rocket engine and engage the jet engines.

## Out of Atmosphere

A standard out of atmosphere transition starts by beginning a climb upwards. When reaching 50,000 the jet engines will begin losing power due to the reduced air density. This is when you add throttle to the rocket engines and can remove the jet engines power entirely. When the aircraft is no longer affected by the drag of the atmosphere it is considered in out of atmosphere flight.

A quicker method is to pull back into a vertical attitude and apply full rocket force. Ascend rapidly and when passing 50,000 feet, remove the jet engine's power. This can cause the pilot to undergo extremely high G-Forces and requires special training for the pilot to be authorized to perform this maneuver.

When exiting the localized atmosphere of a spacecraft carrier simply fly as normal to the border of the localized atmosphere. When crossing this you will simultaneously lose power from the jet engines and lose drag and gravity. Your aircraft will continue on the previous set course and give you time to switch to out of atmosphere flight mode as you wish. It is recommended to switch quickly in order to regain control of the aircraft and continue on the flight plan.
